## BIOGRAPHY

Peter Rasmussen is a Data Scientist based in Washington, DC. His multi-disciplinary background gives him a broad set of skills to tackle complex, unstructured problems.

Prior to joining Accenture Federal Services, Peter was a lead data scientist at Gallup where he delivered high-value, high-visibility analyses and syntheses to senior leaders through the creative application of best-practice data science techniques. Before Gallup, Peter worked for a boutique management consultancy where he led the development of a SaaS data product and performed multiple quantitative analyses for clients in emerging markets, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Before that, he worked for a Somali-Kenyan startup where he led a research team in analyzing investments in renewable energy and agricultural technologies, engineering design, and financial evaluation of potential projects.

Peter has a Masters and Bachelors in Industrial Engineering and Chemical Engineering, respectively, plus a certification from Metis, a data science bootcamp.

## EXPERIENCE

<!-- @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ -->
### ACCENTURE FEDERAL
`Jan 2019 - Present` __DATA SCIENTIST__ Washington, DC

__Commute Optimization Project__ Designed and developed software that recommends - using a bipartite matching algorithm - optimal set of intra-company role swaps that minimize commute times. Organized data processing into discrete tasks using a Python-based workflow automation tool: acquisition, cleaning, routing, post-routing processing, recommendation, and reporting.

### Gallup
`Feb 2017 - Aug 2019` __Lead Data Scientist__ Washington, DC

*Automation of Survey Data Processing* Designed data processing pipeline for global, multi-million dollar polling project to automate country-level survey data cleaning processes that used to be carried out manually. Impact: Processing time reduced from up to three months to less than three hours per survey.

*Hierarchical Personality Clustering* Trained ensemble of dimensionality reduction and hierarchical Gaussian mixture models to cluster personality assessment data into hierarchically organized personality types.

*Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction* As part of an AI project for a defense entity to create an ensemble of models to generate hypotheses for a domain of knowledge, I 1) built a research article scraping tool to retrieve and process open source papers and 2) developed a script to parse Markov Logic Network data and store it in a graph database. Please visit [repo](https://github.com/GallupGovt/multivac) to see which portions of the codebase I contributed to.

*Hierarchical Engagement Visualization Tool* Created JavaScript tool that uses D3 to visualize employee engagement hierarchically. That is, manager-to-manager engagement relationships from CEO down to the lowest level manager. Decision-makers can use tool to clearly see how the engagement of one manager affects their subordinate managers' engagement.

*Understanding Group Biases* As part of an AI solution for a defense research entity to understand group biases, designed and coded a web scraping tool to retrieve, organize, and assimilate reader comments data from popular press articles across the political spectrum. Please visit [repo](https://github.com/GallupGovt/ugb) to see which portions of the code base I contributed to.

### GALLUP
`Feb 2017 - Jan 2019` __Application Developer__ Washington, DC

*Price Optimization Model* Used Bayesian structural time series and econometric techniques to estimate optimal pricing that influenced senior leadership to drastically change prices of signature products with potential multi-million dollar YoY impact on revenue.

*Job Title Classifier* Built logistic regression job title classifier using NLP techniques to generate standardized set of job types, which we used as data inputs to score marketing leads.

*Analysis of Global Coaching Market* To inform senior leadership's strategy regarding coaches, led the quantitative analysis of the global coaching market. Identified key market segments and quantified served and addressable portions of each. Organized findings into presentation and delivered my portion of the work to key stakeholders.

*Strengths Coach Bot* Key member of initiative to prototype an Amazon Alexa-powered coach chat bot. My contributions included 1) connecting each piece of the application together so that it functioned as required; 2) debugging code; 3) meeting with senior leadership to discuss strategic options to continue to develop the prototype; 4) meeting with prospective client at its annual leadership retreat to discuss how the prototype could prove beneficial; 5) demonstrating utility of prototype to subset of retreat attendees, who by and large liked the prototype.

*Ongoing Ecommerce Reporting* Created data acquisition, cleaning, and analysis jobs in Python to generate reports for key stakeholders on various aspects of firm's ecommerce business.
