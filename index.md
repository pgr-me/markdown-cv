`2019-Now` __Data Scientist__ Washington, DC

*USDA COVID Analytics Team* Oversaw team's data science and engineering operations. Developed ETL job to load Census data into enterprise data warehouse. Trained regression model using loan data to understand drivers of loan delinquencies.

*Census Self-Response Quality Assurance* Trained supervised learning model to detect bot activity, synthesized analytical outputs into presentation, and presented actionable findings to customer. [Designed and developed Python machine learning pipeline to ETL external and internal datasets that fed into unsupervised learning model](https://github.com/pgr-me/geoclusterizer). Created ETL pipeline in Python to move tens of millions of records from Hadoop to Oracle to faciliatate subsequent analysis in Oracle.

*Commute Optimization Project* Designed and developed software that recommends - using a bipartite matching algorithm - optimal set of intra-company role swaps that minimize commute times. Organized data processing into discrete tasks using a Python-based workflow automation tool: acquisition, cleaning, routing, post-routing processing, recommendation, and reporting.

`2019` __Lead Data Scientist__ Washington, DC

*Automation of Survey Data Processing* Designed data processing pipeline for global, multi-million dollar polling project to automate country-level survey data cleaning processes that used to be carried out manually. Impact: Processing time reduced from up to three months to less than three hours per survey.

*Hierarchical Personality Clustering* Trained ensemble of dimensionality reduction and hierarchical Gaussian mixture models to cluster personality assessment data into hierarchically organized personality types.

*[Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction](https://github.com/GallupGovt/multivac)* As part of an AI project for a defense research entity to create an ensemble of models to generate hypotheses for a domain of knowledge, I 1) built a research article scraping tool to retrieve and process open source papers and 2) developed a script to parse Markov Logic Network data and store it in a graph database.

*Hierarchical Engagement Visualization Tool* Created JavaScript tool that uses D3 to visualize employee engagement hierarchically. That is, manager-to-manager engagement relationships from CEO down to the lowest level manager. Decision-makers can use tool to clearly see how the engagement of one manager affects their subordinate managers' engagement.

*[Understanding Group Biases](https://github.com/GallupGovt/ugb)* As part of an AI solution for a defense research entity to understand group biases, designed and coded a web scraping tool to retrieve, organize, and assimilate reader comments data from popular press articles across the political spectrum.

<!-- 2017.2-2019.1-->
`2017-2019` __Application Developer__ Washington, DC

*Price Optimization Model* Used Bayesian structural time series and econometric techniques to estimate optimal pricing that influenced senior leadership to drastically change prices of signature products with potential multi-million dollar YoY impact on revenue.

*Job Title Classifier* Built logistic regression job title classifier using NLP techniques to generate standardized set of job types, which we used as data inputs to score marketing leads.

*Analysis of Global Coaching Market* To inform senior leadership's strategy regarding coaches, led the quantitative analysis of the global coaching market. Identified key market segments and quantified served and addressable portions of each. Organized findings into presentation and delivered my portion of the work to key stakeholders.

*Strengths Coach Bot* Key member of initiative to prototype an Amazon Alexa-powered coach chat bot. My contributions included 1) connecting each piece of the application together so that it functioned as required; 2) debugging code; 3) meeting with senior leadership to discuss strategic options to continue to develop the prototype; 4) meeting with prospective client at its annual leadership retreat to discuss how the prototype could prove beneficial; and 5) demonstrating utility of prototype to subset of retreat attendees, who by and large liked the prototype.

*Ongoing Ecommerce Reporting* Created data acquisition, cleaning, and analysis jobs in Python to generate reports for key stakeholders on various aspects of firm's ecommerce business.
