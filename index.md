## Biography

Peter Rasmussen is a Data Scientist based in Washington, DC. His multi-disciplinary background gives him a broad set of skills to tackle complex, unstructured problems.

Prior to joining Accenture Federal Services, Peter was a lead data scientist at Gallup where he delivered high-value, high-visibility analyses and syntheses to senior leaders through the creative application of best-practice data science techniques. Before Gallup, Peter worked for a boutique management consultancy where he led the development of a SaaS data product and performed multiple quantitative analyses for clients in emerging markets, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Before that, he worked for a Somali-Kenyan startup where he led a research team in analyzing investments in renewable energy and agricultural technologies, engineering design, and financial evaluation of potential projects.

Peter has a Masters and Bachelors in Industrial Engineering and Chemical Engineering, respectively, plus a certification from Metis, a data science bootcamp.

## Experience

### Accenture Federal
`2019.8 - Now`
__Data Scientist,__ Washington, DC

__Commute Optimization Project__ Designed and developed software that recommends - using a bipartite matching algorithm - optimal set of intra-company role swaps that minimize commute times. Organized data processing into discrete tasks using a Python-based workflow automation tool: acquisition, cleaning, routing, post-routing processing, recommendation, and reporting.

### Gallup
__Washington, DC__

`Feb 2017 - Aug 2019`
__Lead Data Scientist__
* ASDF
* ASDF

__Automation of Survey Data Processing__ Designed data processing pipeline for global, multi-million dollar polling project to automate country-level survey data cleaning processes that used to be carried out manually. Impact: Processing time reduced from up to three months to less than three hours per survey.

__Hierarchical Personality Clustering__ Trained ensemble of dimensionality reduction and hierarchical Gaussian mixture models to cluster personality assessment data into hierarchically organized personality types.

__Automating Scientific Knowledge Extraction__ As part of an AI project for a defense entity to create an ensemble of models to generate hypotheses for a domain of knowledge, I 1) built a research article scraping tool to retrieve and process open source papers and 2) developed a script to parse Markov Logic Network data and store it in a graph database. Please visit [repo](https://github.com/GallupGovt/multivac) to see which portions of the codebase I contributed to.

__Hierarchical Engagement Visualization Tool__ Created JavaScript tool that uses D3 to visualize employee engagement hierarchically. That is, manager-to-manager engagement relationships from CEO down to the lowest level manager. Decision-makers can use tool to clearly see how the engagement of one manager affects their subordinate managers' engagement.

__Understanding Group Biases__ As part of an AI solution for a defense research entity to understand group biases, designed and coded a web scraping tool to retrieve, organize, and assimilate reader comments data from popular press articles across the political spectrum. Please visit https://github.com/GallupGovt/ugb to see which portions of the code base I contributed to.
